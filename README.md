# Coding Journey of Non-Technical Girl From Nepal
This is the repository where I intend to write my progress throughout learning Python Programming Language and Data Science field. I am compeletly new to even a HTML and I am on complete delimma what to do and what not. But I made a decision that I am not going to do my Masters on Mathematics. I will try to write what I learned on each day and If possible I will include the links to reference.
